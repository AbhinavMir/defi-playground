# DeFi <> Solidity playground

Using Solidity to perform basic DeFi functions. Swap tokens, borrow tokens, take out flashloans, buy/mint NFTs, airdrop workflow, use EIP-4626 Vaults, create wrapped tokens, stake/unstake, having vested tokens, bridge tokens, write yearn strats etc. A mix of these tasks as well - such as stake ETH on Lido, find a high-yield strat to play around StETH with. All done on main-net ganache fork.
